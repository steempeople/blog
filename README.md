### Introduction

steempeople is based on steemblog. I added some features.

`steemblog` is a blog service that syncs your steem blogs into [https://steemblog.github.io](https://steemblog.github.io) pages. It's built based on steem APIs and [hexo](https://hexo.io) blog framework.

### Features

1. Synchronize posts from steem by account to https://steemblog.github.io/@{account} daily.
1. With the help of hexo themes, the blog is easier to read, search, archive, etc.

You can find my blog from [https://steemblog.github.io/@robertyan](https://steemblog.github.io/@robertyan) as an example.


### How to Sync Your Blogs

To use the blog service, we simply add your steem account name to the STEEM_ACCOUNTS variable of this project's Travis CI job, then the synchronization will be done daily automatically.

You may contact [@robertyan](https://busy.org/@robertyan) if you need help to setup the service in steemblog.
